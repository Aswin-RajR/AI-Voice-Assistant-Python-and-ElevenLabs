Your Splendid Seven Days in Tamil Nadu, Sir

Day one: Chennai - Start with Marina Beach, because nothing says vacation like getting sand in your shoes. Visit Kapaleeshwarar Temple, if you fancy some spiritual enlightenment.

Day two: Mahabalipuram - Marvel at the Shore Temple, standing there since the eighth century (slightly longer than your patience will last in the heat).

Day three: Pondicherry - Enjoy French architecture and pretend you're in Paris, just with more curry and less croissants. Visit Auroville for some peace and quiet, if that's your thing.

Day four: Thanjavur - The Brihadeeswarar Temple awaits, a thousand-year-old architectural marvel that will make your house look rather inadequate.

Day five: Madurai - The Meenakshi Temple, because one temple is never enough. The local markets will test your bargaining skills, sir.

Day six: Ooty - Escape to the hills, ride the charming toy train, and visit tea plantations. Because nothing says luxury like sipping tea at six thousand feet.

Day seven: Kodaikanal - End your journey in the Princess of Hill stations. The lake view will almost make you forget about returning to reality.

Do pack light, sir. The Tamil Nadu heat doesn't appreciate excessive baggage. And yes, carrying water is rather essential, unless dehydration is part of your travel goals.

Yours sarcastically,
Your AI Butler
